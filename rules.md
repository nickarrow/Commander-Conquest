# Commander Conquest Rules
Commander Conquest (CC) is a fan-made, non-offical, format for the Magic the Gathering trading card game. 

Unless otherwise stated here, the standard rules for [MTG Commander](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Commander_(format)) apply.

## Winning the game
The player with the highest point total when the game clock reaches zero is the winner. 

## Points
Players may gain points in two ways:
1. For every point of other player life lost as the result of a player action (creature attacks, spells, triggers, etc.), the attacking player gains 1 point.
2. For each conquered land, the conquering player receives 10 points. 

## Game Clock
At the start of the game, a 12-sided die is placed in the center of the table, set to side 12. This represents the game clock. After each round, the clock must be advanced (decreased) by 1. Then, starting with the player with the highest score, each player may advance the clock one additional side if they choose to do so. 

## Playing lands
The first three lands a player puts into play are placed in front of them. These lands may be tapped and function like any other lands played in the game, except that creatures must be cast onto these lands, and other players may attempt to invade and conquer these lands. All other lands played by a player should be placed apart from the initial three, and may be tapped and function per standard commander rules. 

## FAQ
1. If a conquered land is invaded and conquered by another player, does the player who lost the land lose 10 points? **A: Yes.**
2. If a player gains life, does this effect other players' scores in any way? **A: No.**
