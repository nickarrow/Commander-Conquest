# Commander Conquest Rules v0.1
Commander Conquest (CC) is a fan-made, non-offical, format for the Magic the Gathering trading card game. 

Unless otherwise stated here, the standard rules for [MTG Commander](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Commander_(format)) apply.

## Winning the game
The player with the highest point total when the game clock reaches zero is the winner. 

## Points
Players may gain points in two ways:
1. For every point of other player life lost as the result of a player action (creature attacks, spells, triggers, etc.), the attacking player gains 1 point.
2. For each conquered land, the conquering player receives 10 points. 

## Game Clock
At the start of the game, a 12-sided die is placed in the center of the table, set to side 12. This represents the game clock. After each round, the clock must be advanced (decreased) by 1. Then, starting with the player with the highest score, each player may advance the clock one additional side if they choose to do so. 

## Playing lands
Lands are played per normal Commander rules, with the following exceptions:
1. The first three lands a player puts into play are placed in the center of the table, in front of them. These three lands become the "terrain" for each player.
2. The terrain lands may be tapped and function like any other lands played in the game, except that creatures must be cast onto these lands, and;
3. Other players may attempt to invade and conquer the terrain lands.

All other lands played by a player should be placed apart from the terrain lands, and may be tapped and function per standard commander rules. 

## Summoning Creatures
When a creature is summoned or created (including a player's commander), the creature must be attached to one of the three terrain lands. The creature may attack or block per standard commander rules, but they may only do so realted to the land they are "attached". 
> For example, a creature is summoned and attached to a player's "Island terrain" (one of the three land cards for the current player). This creature does not have haste, so they may not attack this turn, but this creature will be able to defend and block an invasion into this land from another player (per the standard attacking and blocking rules).

## Invading lands
At the start of combat phase a player may choose to "invade" another player's terrain land with an attacking creature. To do so, the attacking player declares which creature will be invading which land, and then moves the invading creature card onto the targeted terrain land. During the combat phase, if the terrain land has a defending creature, the defending player may block choose to block the attacking creature. If the terrain land does not have a defending creature, the invasion is successful, and the land becomes "conquered". 

## FAQ
